# Pang Project by TDM Studios!

Hi! We are a group of students in Developing and Design of Videogames in the university UPC CITM, Barcelona. 
Our objective is to bring you out memories with the making of a recreation of the Arcade game Pang!

## Description of the game:

The game is about the Buster Brothers: two guys who are requested to save the world from the terrifying threat that a bunch of bouncing baloons are, frightening and destroying several Earth's landmarks. The adventure will take you and our two heroes from the Mt. Fuji to Barcelona, Taj Mahal, and more iconical Earth's locations.

## How to play and controls:

> The game consists of a player (or 2) who dodges and shoots some kind of ballons or balls. He can only move horizontally on the floor, though some levels include stairs, and cannot jump. Balls appear the same spot and amount in each level, as losing one life by being hit results in that level restarting until the player either completes it or loses all lives. The level/stage gets completed after all balls have been destroyed.

> The game gets you through over 17 stages (the original version) and provides the player some power-ups quite often. Balls just bounce, but the items are needed to clear them faster and to destroy other enemies too, as birds for example, which attack with projectiles.

> Each level the player gets awarded an amount of points depending on the amount of time left (there is a countdown limit), the structures/bonus objects destroyed and, of course, the balls. Chaining same type/size balls results in a crescent streak of bonus points.
