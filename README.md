# Pang Project by TDM Studios

## Who we are:
This is the GitHub page of TDM Studios, a group of students learning how to create videogames under the knowledge of the University UPC CITM.

We decided to recreate Pang (or Buster Bros.), the famous arcade videogame of 1989 where you need to free the world form the devastation of the allmighty ballons.
